&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="3"><strong>What is Android???</strong></font><p><p>

<img src="android-960x854-wallpaper-32.jpg"align="center" height="300" weight="200" hspace="60" vspace="30">


<p>Android is a Linux-based operating system designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablet computers.
Initially developed by Android, Inc., which Google backed financially and later bought in 2005, Android was unveiled in 2007 along with
the founding of the Open Handset Alliance: a consortium of hardware, software, and telecommunication companies devoted to advancing open
standards for mobile devices. The first Android-powered phone was sold in October 2008.

Android is open source and Google releases the code under the Apache License.This open source code and permissive licensing allows the software
to be freely modified and distributed by device manufacturers, wireless carriers and enthusiast developers.
Additionally, Android has a large community of developers writing applications ("apps") that extend the functionality of devices, written primarily
in a customized version of the Java programming language. In October 2012, there were approximately 700,000 apps available for Android, and the estimated
number of applications downloaded from Google Play, Android's primary app store, was 25 billion.

These factors have allowed Android to become the world's most widely used smartphone platform, overtaking Symbian in the fourth quarter of 2010,
and the software of choice for technology companies who require a low-cost, customizable, lightweight operating system for high tech devices without
developing one from scratch. As a result, despite being primarily designed for phones and tablets, it has seen additional applications on televisions,
games consoles, digital cameras and other electronics. Android's open nature has further encouraged a large community of developers and enthusiasts to
use the open source code as a foundation for community-driven projects, which add new features for advanced users or bring Android to devices which
were officially released running other operating systems.

Android had a worldwide smartphone market share of 75% during the third quarter of 2012, with 750 million devices activated in total and 1.5 million
activations per day. The operating system's success has made it a target for patent litigation as part of the so-called "smartphone wars" between technology companies.<p><p>





&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font face="TIMES NEW ROMAN" size="+2"><strong>First New: The Android TV</strong></font>
<img src="google-tv-apps-650x433.jpg"align="center" height="300" weight="200" hspace="30" vspace="30">








Watch out, <a href="1.html"><U>TiVo</U></a>
-- Android has its eye on the boob tube. Google's recently
announced <a href="2.html"><U>Google TV</U></a> concept will bring Android into your living room with
 a series of manufacturer-made devices.

Google TV will combine standard television-watching with an Android-infused
 Internet experience. That means you'll be able to use Google-powered search
 to find TV channels, upcoming shows, and movies -- or to find photos
, videos, and other content online. It'll be one giant entertainment soup,
 all mixed together without distinction. 

What really stands to set Google TV apart, though, is its integration with
 the Android Market. Like Android-based smartphones, Google TV devices will
 connect to an open app store that'll offer an array of applications to hel
p personalize your experience and expand the product's possibilities.

Google TV will run on TV sets, Blu-ray players, and standalone boxes.
 The first of those products are expected to go on sale this fall.<p>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font face="TIMES NEW ROMAN" size="+2"><strong>Second New: The Android Tablet</strong></font>
<img src="android-tablets-top-10-samsung-galaxy-tab-10-1(1).jpg"align="right" height="300" weight="200" hspace="30" vspace="30">


<P>An army of Android tablets is on its way into the world. While Dell's soon-to-launch Streak may be more of a smartphone than a slate, other Android-powered technology more true to the tablet nature is not far behind it.<p>

Among the Android tablets expected to debut in the coming months are an Android-powered Asus Eee Pad; a superthin as-of-yet unnamed Android slate by LG; and a 7-inch iPad-like tablet from Samsung.<p>


You can get a sneak peek at these and other upcoming Android tablets in this PCWorld slideshow.<p>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font face="TIMES NEW ROMAN" size="+2"><strong>Third New: The Android Home Phone System</strong></font>
<img src="4.jpg"align="left" height="200" weight="100" hspace="30" vspace="30">

Taking the home phone system a step further, some companies are working on all-out home control gadgets. The gadgets range from souped-up multimedia remotes -- complete with in-device Internet access, of course -- to fully powered home command centers. The latter will let you do everything from flipping on and off lights to locking doors and even adjusting the A/C. Being lazy has never been easier.<p>

<strong>Usage share of the different versions</strong> as of March 4, 2013.[155] Over half of Android devices in Q2 2013 still run a pre 4.x OS version -mostly 2.3 Gingerbread that was released on December 6, 2010, due to many lower-end devices still being released with it. But more than half of Android devices will run Android 4 or 5 as of Q3 2013.<p>
